<h1 align="center"> Compare compile-time vs runtime polymorphism </h1>


| Compile-time Polymorphism (Static)                                         | Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic)                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Method Overloading (same methods with different parameters etc.)           | Method Overriding – Dynamic Dispatch - Abstracts - Interfaces               |
| Polymorphism is applied during compile time – when program is compiled i.e., converted from code to machine code. | Polymorphism is applied during runtime. When program is executed. |
| Inheritance may not be necessary.                                          | Inheritance is necessary.                          |
| Faster                                                                     | Slower but more useful and flexible.               |
| Example in [Calculator.java](Calculator.java).                             | Example in [Payment.java](Payment.java).
