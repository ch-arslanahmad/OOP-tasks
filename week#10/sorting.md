# Sorting
In programming & specifically DSA, it is one of the basic & essential topics of DSA.

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a particular order.
Sorting can be:
- Ascending (0 --> n)
- Decending (n --> n)
- Alphabetical sorting (a --> z or vice versa)

For example, an array of
`{1000, -7, 300, 7, 100, -1}`
after sorting will be: 
`{-7, -1, 100, 300, 1000}`

There are many types of sorting techniques, some popular are:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
