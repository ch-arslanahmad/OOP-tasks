# DSA
Data Structure & Algorithms is a topic/subject which as its name suggests deals with data structures and algorithms.
To get a basic understanding of DSA, i will do the following tasks:
1. Practice basic DSA problems: Arrays & Strings
**Arrays:**

- Find sum, max, min of an array.
- Reverse an array.
- Find the largest subarray sum (simple brute-force / optimized).

Done in [Array](Array.java)

**Strings:**

- Reverse a string.
- Count vowels, consonants.
- Check if two strings are anagrams.
- Remove duplicates from an array or string.

Done in [Strings](string.java)

1. Practice DSA: Search, Sort, Palindrome

**Search:**

- Linear search in an array.
- Binary search in a sorted array.

Done in [Search](Search.java)

**Sorting:**

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort

Done in [Sorting](Sorting.java)


**Palindrome:**

- Check if a string is a palindrome.
- Check if a number is a palindrome.

 Done in [Palindrome](Palindrome.java).
